Files associated with FLAM analysis.

meta_sigSNPs_50kb_pvals.txt
Text file containing frequency and SNP position of all "representative" SNPs of each 50kb region. The production of this file is described in "CMH (Detecting differentiation)".

metabolomics_fixed.csv
Metabolomics values for each of the 30 populations for the previously found significantly different metabolites.

FLAM_geno_to_meta.R
R script for FLAM to use genomic SNP data to predict the significantly differentiated metabolomic values of 30 populations. Each metabolite is predicted individually.
